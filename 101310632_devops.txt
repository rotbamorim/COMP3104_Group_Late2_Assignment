The COMP 3104 DevOps course is a course in the 3rd year of the T177/T127 Program at George Brown College. The course teaches further skills with the Git Bash tool, Github, Github Actions, and other tools that help developers make commits and changes to projects. Unlike most courses, this course only has one large session instead of being split into lecture and lab components.
